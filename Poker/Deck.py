""" This class implements a deck of 52 playing cards, where cards are 
    defined in the Card class.   A deck is just a list of Card objects, one 
    for each legal combination of rank and suit. 

    The class defines the following methods:

    Deck( ):  creates a new Deck object of 52 Cards;
    d.__str__(): generate the print representation of Deck d, using the
         str function on each of the individual Cards it contains;
    d.shuffle(): replace d by a random permutation of d (the works since
         d is represented as a mutable list of Cards;
    d.deal(): remove a Card from the front of the deck and return it;
    d.len(): return the number of Cards remaining in deck d.
    comparisons <, >, <=, >=, == between two Card objects.
