""" This class implements playing cards.  A card is
    specified with a string RS of two characters, where R denotes the
    rank and S the suit.  For example, "AH" denotes the Ace of
    Hearts, "4S" denotes the 4 of Spades.  Legal ranks and suits are
    defined by the constants CARDRANKS and CARDSUITS.  Note that we use
    "T" to designate a 10, so as to use only two characters for the 
    specifier. 

    The class defines the following methods:

    Card( RS ):  creates a new Card object of rank R and suit S;
    c.__str__(): generate the print representation of Card c;
    c.getRank(): return the rank of card c;
    c.getSuit(): return the suit of card c;
    comparisons <, >, <=, >=, == between two Card objects.

"""

# new Card objects.  Notice that Ace is high in this enumeration, but can
# also be low.  For example, legal straights are (A, 2, 3, 4, 5) or 
# (T, J, Q, K, A).  Some code must take this into account.
